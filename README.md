# 🚗 Vehicle Management System (C++)

A simple **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project built in **C++**, demonstrating key concepts like **classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and constructors**.

---

## 🧩 Features
- **Base Class:** `Vehicle` → make, model, year, color  
- **Derived Classes:**
  - `Car` → number of doors, trunk check  
  - `Bike` → engine type, two-wheeler check  

---

## ⚙️ Concepts Used
- Classes & Objects  
- Constructors (Default & Parameterized)  
- Encapsulation (Access Modifiers)  
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel)  
- Function Chaining & Scope Resolution  

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand how to:
- Structure programs using OOP principles  
- Manage relationships between base and derived classes  
- Write reusable and organized C++ code
